hi, this is just a collection of simple scripts to speed up your MIKE processing using mikeio :) this repo includes:
* comparison of data points from several scenarios (mean, max)
* plotting of difference between multiple scenarios & baseline case
* grouping point series with random # of items per group
* [SOON] updating .frv templates in batch
* [SOON] tidal analysis & prediction in batch (need to figure out how the pfs file works)
