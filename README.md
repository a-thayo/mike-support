hi, this is just a collection of simple scripts to speed up your MIKE processing using mikeio :) this repo includes:
* comparison of data points from several scenarios (mean, max)
* plotting of difference between multiple scenarios & baseline case
* grouping point series with random # of items per group
* [SOON] updating .frv templates in batch
* creating pfs file for tide prediction (using tidhpc.exe tool)
